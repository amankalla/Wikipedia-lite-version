# Wikipedia-lite-version
The project ‘Wikipedia Lite Version’ is a Database project where we can store data. Data which is stored in the database can be acquired by giving proper input.
This project works like a ‘Dictionary’ where limited data can be searched in limited database.
The working of this project as similar to search engines with requirements of database. Database is stored in the backend which is made using Node,js and MongoDB

Search Engines or dictionary are the things which provide useful knowledge or information according to user’s wish.
Inspired from things mentioned above, this project is made.
The project consists of front-end user interface from which we can type the data or information which we want to search. After the input is given, rest of the part is done by backend.
Software searches the information about the input in the database and present it on the user interface. By this, we will get our required output.
